# Interview and development notes

1. Vanilla JavaScript was used. There are only dev-dependencies in package.json.
2. Webpack was used to make one bundle file from all the source JavaScript files. 
3. The theme was written in a seperate file. It is a common practise in CSS.
4. Two themes were written textBeside and textInside. By changing the import in index.js different theme can be used.
5. The anchor elements (links) got `rel="nofollow"` attribute for not damaging SEO.
